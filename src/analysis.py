# Example usage:

# Create an instance of TradeAnalyzer with the loaded trades
# analyzer = TradeAnalyzer(trades)

# Perform analysis tasks
# portfolio_returns = analyzer.calculate_portfolio_returns()
# performance_metrics = analyzer.calculate_performance_metrics()
# analyzer.generate_report()

# Other analysis-related operations can be performed as needed
