    # Method to integrate trades from external sources
    def integrate_trades(self, source):
        # Implement the logic to integrate trades from the specified source
        # This can involve fetching trades from APIs, reading from files, or connecting to external systems
        # Process the retrieved trades and perform any necessary data transformations
        # Return the integrated trades data

    # Method to validate the integrity of integrated trades
    def validate_trades(self, trades):
        # Implement the logic to validate the integrity of the integrated trades data
        # This can involve checking for duplicate trades, verifying trade attributes, or performing data consistency checks
        # Return the validated trades data
        pass

    # Method to reconcile integrated trades with existing portfolio data
    def reconcile_trades(self, trades, portfolio):
        # Implement the logic to reconcile the integrated trades with the existing portfolio data
        # This can involve checking for conflicts, adjusting portfolio positions, or updating trade records
        # Return the updated trades and portfolio data
        pass

    # Other methods for trade integration and processing can be added as needed
