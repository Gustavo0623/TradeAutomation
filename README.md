## Testing

### Introduction

* Welcome to the Trade Automation application! Trade Automation is a powerful tool designed to streamline and automate trade-related processes. This application aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of managing trades, enabling users to easily track and analyze their trading activities.

### Test Driven Development and Importance

* One of the key principles guiding the development of Trade Automation is Test Driven Development (TDD). Test Driven Development is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. By following TDD, developers create automated tests to define the desired behavior of the code and then implement the code to pass those tests.

* The importance of Test Driven Development lies in its ability to ensure the reliability, correctness, and maintainability of the application's codebase. By writing tests first, developers gain a clear understanding of the expected behavior and outcomes of their code. This practice leads to more robust and bug-free software, reduces the risk of introducing regressions, and promotes better design and modularization of the codebase.

* In Trade Automation, we embrace Test Driven Development to provide a solid foundation for the application's functionality. By focusing on writing tests upfront, we can verify the behavior of our code and make confident modifications without compromising the stability of the application. Through a comprehensive test suite, we strive to deliver a high-quality, dependable, and resilient trading solution.

* In the following sections, you will find detailed information on how to set up the testing environment, run the tests, and contribute to the testing efforts of Trade Automation. Let's ensure the integrity and reliability of our application through the power of testing!

### Test Framework

* The testing framework we are using in this project is unittest. unittest is a built-in testing framework in Python that provides a rich set of tools and features for creating and running tests.

* With unittest, you can define test cases as classes and write individual test methods within them. These test methods can contain assertions to verify the expected behavior of your code. The framework provides various methods for running tests, generating test reports, and managing test suites.

* In our Trade Automation project, we leverage the unittest framework to create comprehensive test cases and ensure the correctness and reliability of our codebase. By utilizing the capabilities of unittest, we can design and execute tests to cover different scenarios, validate inputs and outputs, and detect any issues or regressions in our application.

#### Set Up Testing Environment

* TBC ...

### Testing Strategy 

#### Unit Testing:

* Write unit tests for individual components, such as classes, functions, or methods.
* Focus on testing the smallest units of code in isolation.
* Mock or stub external dependencies to isolate the unit under test.
* Verify the behavior and correctness of individual units.

#### Integration Testing:

* Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components and modules.
* Test the integration points and the flow of data between components.
* Use real or simulated dependencies to test the interactions.
* Ensure the components work correctly together.
